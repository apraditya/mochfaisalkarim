    "title": "Understanding Indonesian Foreign Policy through Role Theory",
    "description": "This article analyses how foreign policy makers legitimise their enactment of role conceptions to play a more active role at the global level given the lack of domestic encouragement to pursue such an expansive foreign policy. To answer the question, this article applies symbolic interactionist role theory to understand the impetus for states to enact particular role conceptions by examining the changes in ego and alter expectations. In order to reduce the likelihood of domestic role contestation while at the same time subscribe towards ego and alter expectations, it is necessary for policy makers to legitimise role conceptions and their enactments towards potentially reluctant domestic audiences. This article develops the notion of role legitimation to capture this process and puts forward two social mechanisms through which role legitimation is performed. The first mechanism is reviving the historical roles from a specific historical period that is deeply entrenched as an inalienable historical feature of the state while the second one is reproducing the alter expectations into the domestic political discourse. To illustrate the argument, this article utilises the case of Indonesiaâ€™s role conceptions to play a greater role at the global level during Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono Presidency (2004-14)."
