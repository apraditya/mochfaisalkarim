    "title": "Domestic Source of Indonesia's Behaviour in the UN Human Rights Council",
    "description": "Although post-authoritarian Indonesia emerges as a state that strongly advocates the values and principles of human rights and democracy in the Asia-Pacific region, its policies in promoting these values at the global level remain limited. This can be seen in Indonesia’s ambivalent role in strengthening global human rights governance particularly the United Nations (UN) Human Rights Council. In addressing the puzzle, this article argues that Indonesia’s long unpleasant experience while protecting its territorial integrity under UN scrutiny during the authoritarian regime (1967–1998) as well as its current domestic issue regarding the separatist movement in Papua have made Indonesia reluctant to strengthen the global governance dealing with human rights issues which might undermine its territorial integrity in the future. Furthermore, besides its sensitivity towards the notion of territorial integrity, its preference for a regional approach, as well as its aspiration to be a bridge-builder have made Indonesia tend to defend developing countries undergoing international scrutiny of their human rights situation in the UN Human Rights Council. Thus, Indonesia’s standpoint regarding human rights issue at the global level that seems to undermine the Western liberal international order does not stem from Indonesia’s search for autonomy from the western values. It is primarily driven by Indonesia’s domestic situation as well as its aspiring international roles particularly as a bridge-builder pursued in the post-authoritarian era."
